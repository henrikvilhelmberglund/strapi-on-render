# Deploy Strapi to Render

This is a sample [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) app, configured for deployment to [Render](https://render.com). It uses a SQLite database, which is stored on a [persistent disk](https://render.com/docs/disks) along with uploaded Media Library files.

Fork this repo and click the button below to deploy.
